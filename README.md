# VBA-challenge
In this assignment, I utilized VBA to create a loop that analyzes a set of financial data and calculates key information about the data set including the ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year and the total stock volume of the stock. The program also calculates the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease and the greatest total volume of the stocks included in the dataset. The loop runs simultaneously for each year of data included in the Excel worksheet.
