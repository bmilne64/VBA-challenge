# Wallstreet Stock Insights 

In this project, I utilized VBA to create a loop that analyzes a set of financial data and calculates key information about the data set including the ticker symbol, the yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year and the total stock volume of the stock. 

The program also calculates the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease and the greatest total volume of the stocks included in the dataset. 

The loop runs simultaneously for each year of data included in the Excel worksheet.

This analysis provides key financial insights to inform the company about its stock trends to help the company predict future trends.
